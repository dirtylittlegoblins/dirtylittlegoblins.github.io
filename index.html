    <section class="about us">
      <p>
        Product managers and engineers by day, elves and halflings by night.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are Dirty Little Goblins, a group of D&D enthusiasts in Liverpool,
        UK. For years, we were using pen and paper to take notes during the
        game. Then it struck, what if all that data was available in one app,
        powerful yet extremely easy to use and our DMs could access it live?
      </p>
      <p>
        Our D&D 5e Inventory and Spells app is already being used in over 100
        countries, with nearly a million app launches. We’re working on
        extending functionality to cover everything that is needed for a great
        D&D campaign. Whilst still playing ourselves, our goal is to build the
        best unofficial tools for Dungeons and Dragons players and their Dungeon
        Masters.
